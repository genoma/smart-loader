# SmartLoader Plugin for jQuery 1.9.X / 2.0.X

This plugin provides a way to show the whole content of the page   only when all images are loaded, or alternatively shows a loader image until the image is fully loaded.

At this moment SmartLoader is still in a beta release quality and still needs some work and tests to be fully functional, but feel free to try it and to report here any problems you've encountered.

## Instructions

1. Needed Files : js/smart-loader.min.js
2. smart-loader-loaders folder

Read carefully index.html with your browser of choice.

## TODO

2. Marco's Images
